    Firſt, let there be magnitudes $\redhome \bcomma \bluediamond \bcomma \yellowsquare \bcomma$\\
    and as many others $\reddiamond \bcomma \bbluedrop \bcomma \yellowcircle \bcomma$ ſuch that\\
    $\redhome \bcolon \bluediamond \bbcolon \reddiamond \bcolon \bbluedrop \bcomma$\\
    and $\bluediamond \bcolon \yellowsquare \bbcolon \bbluedrop \bcolon \yellowcircle \bsemicolon$\\
    then ſhall $\redhome \bcolon \yellowsquare \bbcolon \reddiamond \bcolon \yellowcircle \bperiod$
\end{center}

\raggedright Let theſe magnitudes, as well as any equimultiples whatever of the antecedents and conſequents of the ratios, ſtand as follows:---

\begin{center}
    $\redhome \bcomma \bluediamond \bcomma \yellowsquare \bcomma \reddiamond \bcomma \bbluedrop \bcomma \yellowcircle \bcomma$ and\\
    $\text{M} \redhome \bcomma \textit{m} \bluediamond \bcomma \text{N} \yellowsquare \bcomma \text{M} \reddiamond \bcomma \textit{m} \bbluedrop \bcomma  \text{N} \yellowcircle \bcomma$\\
    becauſe $\redhome \bcolon \bluediamond \bbcolon \reddiamond \bcolon \bbluedrop \bsemicolon$\\
    $\btherefore \text{M} \redhome \bcolon \textit{m} \bluediamond \bbcolon \text{M} \reddiamond \bcolon \textit{m} \bbluedrop$ [\hyperref[book5pr4]{\textsc{V.} 4}].
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    For the ſame reaſon\\
    $\textit{m} \bluediamond \bcolon \text{N} \yellowsquare \bbcolon \textit{m} \bbluedrop \bcolon \text{N} \yellowcircle \bsemicolon$\\
    and becauſe there are three magnitudes,\\
    $\text{M} \redhome \bcomma \textit{m} \bluediamond \bcomma \text{N} \yellowsquare \bcomma$\\
    and other three $\text{M} \reddiamond \bcomma \textit{m} \bbluedrop \bcomma \text{N} \yellowcircle \bcomma$\\
    which, taken two and two, have the ſame ratio;
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    $\btherefore$ if $\text{M} \redhome \bgt \bcomma \bequals \bcomma \blt \text{N} \yellowsquare$\\
    then will $\text{M} \reddiamond \bgt \bcomma \bequals \bcomma \blt \text{N} \yellowcircle \bcomma$ by [\hyperref[book5pr20]{\textsc{V.} 20}];\\
    and $\btherefore \redhome \bcolon \yellowsquare \bbcolon \reddiamond \bcolon \yellowcircle$ [\hyperref[book5def5]{\textsc{V.} 5}].
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    Next, let there be four magnitudes, $\bluehome \bcomma \blackdiamond \bcomma \yellowsquare \bcomma \reddiamond \bcomma$\\
    and other four $\bbluedrop \bcomma \blackcircle \bcomma \yellowrectangle \bcomma \redtriangle \bcomma$\\
    which, taken two and two, have the ſame ratio,\\
    that is to ſay, $\bluehome \bcolon \blackdiamond \bbcolon \bbluedrop \bcolon \blackcircle \bcomma$\\
    $\blackdiamond \bcolon \yellowsquare \bbcolon \blackcircle \bcolon \yellowrectangle \bcomma$\\
    and $\yellowsquare \bcolon \reddiamond \bbcolon \yellowrectangle \bcolon \redtriangle \bcomma$\\
    then ſhall $\bluehome \bcolon \reddiamond \bbcolon \bbluedrop \bcolon \redtriangle \bsemicolon$\\
    for, becauſe $\bluehome \bcomma \blackdiamond \bcomma \yellowsquare \bcomma$ are three magnitudes,\\
    and $\bbluedrop \bcomma \blackcircle \bcomma \yellowrectangle \bcomma$ other three,\\
    which, taken two and two, have the ſame ratio;\\
    therefore, by the foregoing caſe, $\bluehome \bcolon \yellowsquare \bbcolon \bbluedrop \bcolon \yellowrectangle \bcomma$\\
    but $\yellowsquare \bcolon \reddiamond \bbcolon \yellowrectangle \bcolon \redtriangle \bsemicolon$\\
    therefore again, by the firſt caſe, $\bluehome \bcolon \reddiamond \bbcolon \bbluedrop \bcolon \redtriangle \bsemicolon$\\
    and ſo on, whatever the number of magnitudes be.

$\btherefore$ If there be any number, \&c.
