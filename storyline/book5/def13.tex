    \raggedright T\textsc{HE} technical term permutando or alternando, by permutation or alternately , is uſed when there are four proportionals, and it is inferred that the firſt has the ſame ratio to the third which the ſecond has to the fourth; or that the firſt is to the third as the ſecond is to the fourth: as it ſhown in the following proposition:---\\

    \hfill

    \begin{center}
        Let $\yellowcircle \bcolon \blackdiamond \bbcolon \redhome \bcolon \bluesquare \bcomma$\\
        by "permutando" or "alternando" it is\\
        inferred $\yellowcircle \bcolon \redhome \bbcolon \blackdiamond \bcolon \bluesquare \bperiod$
    \end{center}

    \hfill

    It may be neceſſary here to remark that the magnitudes $\yellowcircle \bcomma \blackdiamond \bcomma \redhome \bcomma \bluesquare \bcomma$ muſt be homogeneous, that is, of the ſame nature or ſimilitude of kind; we muſt therefore, in ſuch caſes, compare lines with lines, ſurfaces with ſurfaces, ſolids with ſolids, \&c. Hence the ſtudent will readily perceive that a line and a ſurface, a ſurface and a ſolid, or other heterogenous magnitudes, can never ſtand in the relation of antecedent and conſequent.
