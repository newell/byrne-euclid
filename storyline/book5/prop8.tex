        $\btherefore \text{M}'\ \triandsquare$ is $\bgt \textit{m}'\ \bluecircle \bsemicolon$ but it has been ſhown above that\\
        $\text{M}'\ \yellowsquare$ is not $\bgt \textit{m}'\ \bluecircle \bcomma$ therefore, by the \hyperref[book5def7]{ſeventh definition},\\
        \triandsquare has to $\bluecircle$ a greater ratio than $\yellowsquare \bcolon \bluecircle \bperiod$
        \hfill\\

        or, $\bluecircle \bcolon \yellowsquare \bgt \bluecircle \bcolon \triandsquare \bperiod$\\

        Take $\textit{m}'\ \bluecircle \bcomma\ \text{M}'\ \yellowsquare \bcomma\ \textit{m}'\ \bluecircle \bcomma$ and $\text{M}'\ \triandsquare \bcomma$\\
        the ſame as in the firſt caſe, ſuch that\\
        $\text{M}' \blacktriangle$ and $\text{M}'\ \redsquare$ will be each $\bgt \bluecircle \bcomma$ and $\textit{m}'\ \bluecircle$ the leaſt multiple of $\bluecircle \bcomma$ which firſt becomes\\

        $\btherefore \textit{m}'\ \bluecircle$ minus $\bluecircle$ is not $\bgt \text{M}'\ \redsquare \bcomma$\\

    $\btherefore$ Of unequal magnitudes, \&c.

    \hfill

    \raggedright The contrivance employed in this propoſition for finding among multiples taken, as in the \hyperref[book5def5]{fifth definition}, a multiple of the firſt greater than the multiple of the ſecond, but the ſame multiple of the third which has been taken of the firſt, not greater than the ſame multiple of the fourth which has been taken of the ſecond, may be illuſtrated numerically as follows:---\\

    \hfill

    The number 9 has a greater ratio to {\color{cblue}{7}} than {\color{cyellow}{8}} has to {\color{cblue}{7}}: that is, 9 : {\color{cblue}{7}} $\bgt$ {\color{cyellow}{8}} : {\color{cblue}{7}} $\bgt$ {\color{cyellow}{8}} : {\color{cblue}{7}}; or, {\color{cred}{8}} $\bplus$ 1 : {\color{cblue}{7}} $\bgt$ {\color{cyellow}{8}} : {\color{cblue}{7}}.\\
\end{minipage}

\newpage

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
    The multiple of 1, which firſt becomes greater than {\color{cblue}{7}}, is 8 times, therefore we may multiply the firſt and third by 8, 9, 10, or any other greater number; in this caſe, let us multiply the firſt and third by 8, and we have {\color{cred}{64}} $\bplus$ 8 and {\color{cyellow}{64}}: again, the firſt multiple of {\color{cblue}{7}} which becomes greater than 64 is 10 times; then, by multiplying the ſecond and fourth by 10, we ſhall have {\color{cblue}{70}} and {\color{cblue}{70}}; then, arranging theſe multiples, we have---\\

    \hfill

    \begin{center}
        $\overset{\text{8 times the first.}}{{\color{cred}{64}} \bplus 8} \qquad\qquad \overset{\text{10 times the second.}}{{\color{cblue}{70}}} \qquad\qquad \overset{\text{8 times the third.}}{{\color{cyellow}{64}}} \qquad\qquad \overset{\text{10 times the fourth.}}{{\color{cblue}{70}}}$\\
    \end{center}

    Conſequently, {\color{cred}{64}} $\bplus$ 8, or 72, is greater than {\color{cblue}{70}}, but {\color{cyellow}{64}} is not greater than {\color{cblue}{70}}, $\therefore$ by the \hyperref[book5def7]{ſevenfth definition}, 9 has a greater ratio to {\color{cblue}{7}} than {\color{cyellow}{8}} has to {\color{cblue}{7}}.\\

    \hfill

    The above is merely illuſtrative of the foregoing demonſtration, for this property could be ſhown of theſe or other numbers very readily in the following manner; becauſe if an antecedent contains it conſequent a greater number of times than another antecedent contains its conſequent, or when a fraction is formed of an antecedent for the numerator, and its conſequent for the denominator be greater than another fraction which is formed of another antecedent for the numerator and its conſequent for the denominator, the ratio of the firſt antecedent to its conſequent is greater than the ratio of the laſt antecedent to its conſequent.\\

    \hfill

    Thus, the number 9 has a greater ratio to 7, than 8 has to 7, for $\dfrac{\text{9}}{\text{7}}$ is greater than $\dfrac{\text{8}}{\text{7}}$.\\

    \hfill

    Again, 17 : 19 is a greater ratio than 13 : 15, becauſe $\dfrac{\text{17}}{\text{19}} \bequals \dfrac{\text{17} \times \text{15}}{\text{19} \times \text{15}} \bequals \dfrac{\text{255}}{\text{285}}$, and $\dfrac{\text{13}}{\text{15}} \bequals \dfrac{\text{13} \times \text{19}}{\text{15} \times \text{19}} \bequals \dfrac{\text{247}}{\text{285}}$, hence it is evident that $\dfrac{\text{255}}{\text{285}}$ is greater than $\dfrac{\text{247}}{\text{285}}$, $\therefore \dfrac{\text{17}}{\text{19}}$ is greater than $\dfrac{\text{13}}{\text{15}}$, and, according to what has been above ſhown, 17 has to 19 a greater ratio than 13 has to 15.\\

    \hfill

    So that the general terms upon which a greater, equal, or leſs ratio exiſts are as follows:---\\

    \hfill

    If $\dfrac{\text{A}}{\text{B}}$ be greater than $\dfrac{\text{C}}{\text{D}}$, A is ſaid to have to B a greater ratio than C has to D; if $\dfrac{\text{A}}{\text{B}}$ equal to $\dfrac{\text{C}}{\text{D}}$, then A has to B the ſame ratio which C has to D; and if $\dfrac{\text{A}}{\text{B}}$ be leſs than $\dfrac{\text{C}}{\text{D}}$, A is ſaid to have to B a leſs ratio than C has to D.\\
