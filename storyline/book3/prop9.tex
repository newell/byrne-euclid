    \raggedright For if it be ſuppoſed that the point $\img{yellow_and_blue_point}$  in which more than two equal ſtraight lines meet is not the centre, ſome other point  $\bimg{black_and_red_dotted_line}$ muſt be; join theſe two points by $\blackline \bcomma$ and produce it both ways to the circumference.

    \hfill

    Then ſince more than two equal ſtraight lines are drawn from a point which is not the centre, to the circumference, two of them at leaſt muſt lie at the ſame ſide of the diameter $\bimg{red_black_and_red_dotted_line} \bsemicolon$ and ſince from a point $\img{red_yellow_and_blue_point} \bcomma$ which is not the centre, ſtraight lines are drawn to the circumference; the greateſt is $\bimg{black_and_red_dotted_line} \bcomma$ which paſſes through the centre: and $\blueline$ which is nearer to $\bimg{black_and_red_dotted_line} \bcomma \bgt \yellowline$ which is more remote [\hyperref[book3pr8]{\textsc{III.} 8}]; but $\blueline \bequals \yellowline$ [hyp.] which is abſurd.

    \hfill

    The ſame may be demonſtrated of any other point, different from $\img{red_yellow_and_blue_point} \bcomma$ which muſt be the centre of the circle.
